<div class="content">
<p>Healthcare narrative (such as clinical notes, discharge letters, nurse handover notes, imaging reports, patients posts on social media or feedback comments, etc.) has been used as a key communication stream that contains the majority of actionable and contextualised healthcare data, but which – despite being increasingly available in a digital form – is not routinely analysed, and is rarely integrated with other healthcare data on a large-scale. There are many barriers and challenges in processing healthcare free text, including, for example, the variability and implicit nature of language expressions, and difficulties in sharing training and evaluation data. On the other hand, recent years have witnessed increasing opportunities to process free text, with a number of success stories that have demonstrated the feasibility of using advanced Natural Language Processing to unlock evidence contained in free text to support clinical care, patient self-management, epidemiological research and audit.</p>

<h2 style="color:#009999;">Topics</h2>
<p> HealTAC 2024 invites contributions that address any aspect of healthcare text analytics, including (but not limited to) the following topics: </p>

<button class="collapsible">Second call for contributions</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The 7th Healthcare Text Analytics Conference (HealTAC 2024) invites contributions that address any aspect of healthcare text analytics. This year, we invite submissions in the form of extended abstracts that describe either methodological or application work that has not been previously presented in a conference. Submissions (up to 2 pages) should be prepared based on a template that is available at the conference website. 
We also invite PhD and fellowship project submissions that describe ongoing PhD research (any stage) or a planned fellowship application. The conference will provide an opportunity to receive constructive feedback from a panel of experts.
As in previous years, there will be a post-conference open call to submit a journal-length paper for further peer review and publication in Frontiers in Digital Health.</p>

<h2>Contribution types</h2>
<h4 style="color:#009999;">Extended abstracts</h4>
Extended abstracts will describe either methodological or application work that has not been previously presented in a conference. Contributions should be prepared based on a template. Authors will specify their preferred way of presenting their contribution: as an oral presentation, flash/lightning talk, poster or demo. As in previous years, there will be a post-conference open call to submit a journal-length paper for further peer review and publication in Frontiers in Digital Health.  We have already published four issues following the previous HealTAC events. <b>Contributions should consist of up to 2 pages, excluding references</b>.

<h4 style="color:#009999;">PhD and fellowship projects</h4>
Submissions by PhD students or early career researchers will be presented at the separate forum. These should present ongoing PhD research (in any stage) or a planned fellowship application. The forum will provide an opportunity to receive constructive feedback from the community, including a panel that will consist of the keynote speakers and experts in different areas. Contributions should consist of up to 4 pages and will be treated separately from the other submissions.

<h4 style="color:#009999;">Panel discussions</h4>
Panel discussions can be proposed to address the main challenges in processing healthcare free-text or to discuss the future of particular methodologies. Panels will be allocated one hour slots for discussions. Proposals for panels should consist of up to 2 pages.

<h4 style="color:#009999;">Software demo sessions</h4>
Demo sessions will provide a forum for demonstration of solutions and projects to the wider community. Proposals for demos should use the template for extended abstracts.
