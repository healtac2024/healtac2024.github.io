<h2>Contribution types</h2>
<h4>Extended abstracts</h4>
Extended abstracts will describe either methodological or application work that has not been previously presented in a conference. Contributions should be prepared based on a template. Authors will specify their preferred way of presenting their contribution: as an oral presentation, flash/lightning talk, poster or demo. As in previous years, there will be a post-conference open call to submit a journal-length paper for further peer review and publication in Frontiers in Digital Health.  We have already published four issues following the previous HealTAC events.

<h4>PhD and fellowship projects</h4>
Submissions by PhD students or early career researchers will be presented at the separate forum. These should present ongoing PhD research (in any stage) or a planned fellowship application. The forum will provide an opportunity to receive constructive feedback from the community, including a panel that will consist of the keynote speakers and experts in different areas. Contributions should consist of up to 4 pages and will be treated separately from the other submissions.

<h4>Panel discussions</h4>
Panel discussions can be proposed to address the main challenges in processing healthcare free-text or to discuss the future of particular methodologies. Panels will be allocated one hour slots for discussions. Proposals for panels should consist of up to 2 pages.

<h4>Software demo sessions</h4>
Demo sessions will provide a forum for demonstration of solutions and projects to the wider community. Proposals for demos should use the template for extended abstracts.
